Users can interact directly with these applications through the extension without needing to navigate to external platforms. This integration enhances user convenience and fosters engagement with the broader Solana ecosystem.</p><h4>4. <strong>Transaction Capabilities</strong></h4><p>Phantom enables easy sending and receiving of SOL and other SPL tokens.

This extends to gaming applications where NFTs are used for in-game assets and collectibles.</p><h4>3. <strong>Payments and Transfers</strong></h4><p>Users can use Phantom to send and receive SOL and SPL tokens for payments or personal transfers. The fast transaction speeds and low fees make it an attractive option for everyday use.</p><h4>4. <strong>Investment and Asset Management</strong></h4><p>For long-term investors, Phantom provides a secure solution to hold SOL tokens and other assets.
